# Password Strength Checker
## Overview

- The **Password Strength Checker** is a simple, intuitive, and real-time GUI-based tool developed in Python. 
- Its primary purpose is to help users create stronger, more secure passwords by providing immediate feedback on their input and offering actionable suggestions for improvement.
- Weak passwords are a major cause of data breaches. This tool aims to educate users on what constitutes a strong password and guide them towards better security practices.

## Features
* **Real-time Feedback:** As you type, the password strength is immediately analyzed and displayed.
* **Strength Indicator:** Provides clear feedback on strength levels (e.g., "Very Weak", "Weak", "Moderate", "Strong", "Very Strong") with corresponding color coding.
* **Actionable Suggestions:** Offers specific recommendations to improve password strength (e.g., "Include uppercase letters", "Increase password length").
* **Comprehensive Analysis:** Evaluates passwords based on:
    * Length
    * Inclusion of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
    * Avoidance of common patterns (sequences, repetitions)
    * Detection of dictionary words (optional, via NLTK)
* **User-Friendly GUI:** Built with Tkinter for a clean and easy-to-use interface.

## Technologies Used
* **Python 3.x**
* **Tkinter** (for GUI)
* **`re` (Regex)** (for pattern matching)
* **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)** (optional, for dictionary word detection)

## Usage

1.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
2.  A graphical window titled "Password Strength Checker" will appear.
3.  Type your desired password into the "Enter your Password:" field.
4.  Observe the "Strength" indicator and the "Suggestions for Improvement" area, which will update dynamically as you type.

## How it Works
The application is split into two main Python files:
* **`password_analyzer.py`**: This script contains the pure Python logic for assessing password strength. It uses regular expressions (`re`) to check for various character types, common patterns, and optionally, NLTK to identify dictionary words. It assigns a score based on these criteria and generates a list of textual suggestions.
* **`app.py`**: This is the Tkinter application. It sets up the GUI elements (input field, labels, text area). It binds the `<KeyRelease>` event on the password input field, so every time a character is typed or released, it calls the `analyze_password` function from `password_analyzer.py`. The returned strength feedback and suggestions are then updated on the GUI.

## Future Enhancements
* **Entropy Calculation:** Implement a more advanced entropy-based strength calculation.
* **Password Generator:** Add a feature to generate strong, random passwords.
* **Password History Check:** Integration with external APIs (e.g., Have I Been Pwned) to check if a password has been compromised.
* **Customizable Rules:** Allow users to define their own strength criteria.
* **Visual Progress Bar:** A graphical progress bar to visualize strength.
* **Cross-platform Packaging:** Provide standalone executables for different operating systems.
